// has to recognise — each of which has to be answered before the same call is
// worth making again.
//
// MCP has a place for exactly this — the `instructions` field of the initialize
// response — and until now wanctl left it empty, so a host learned the tools
// one description at a time, in whatever order it happened to read them, with
// nothing anywhere saying how they compose. A tool description can say what
// `edit` does; only this can say to read the project's AGENTS.md first.
//
// It is assembled from the same catalog the tools are registered from, so a
// primitive cannot appear here and not exist, and the error texts quoted below
// are the ones the tools actually return. `wanctl help --instructions` prints
// it, which is how anything outside the MCP server — the discovery page, a
// person deciding whether to trust this thing — reads the same words.
//
// The budget is forty lines. It is read before any work, every session, by
// something that pays for every token; the command reference is one
// `wanctl help <command>` away and does not belong here.
